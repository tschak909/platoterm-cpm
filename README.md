# PLATOTERM Skeleton for RunCPM

This is a PLATOTERM skeleton for RunCPM.

It contains a complete RunCPM environment, with a system on drive A:, a copy of HiTech C on B:, the source code on C:, and the binary output on D:.

It needs:

* Keyboard routines, in keyboard.c
* Screen routines, in screen.c
* I/O routines (get/put from socket) in io.c

I've commented out example code throughout each.

# Keyboard Mapping
